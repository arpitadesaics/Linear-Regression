# Linear-Regression
*Linear Regression is the supervised Machine Learning model in which the model finds the best fit linear line between the independent and dependent variable i.e it finds the linear relationship between the dependent and independent variable.

*Linear Regression is of two types: Simple and Multiple. Simple Linear Regression is where only one independent variable is present and the model has to find the linear relationship of it with the dependent variable

*Equation of Simple Linear Regression, where bo is the intercept, b1 is coefficient or slope, x is the independent variable and y is the dependent variable.
 y = b0 + b1x

*Equation of Multiple Linear Regression, where bo is the intercept, b1,b2,b3,b4…,bn are coefficients or slopes of the independent variables x1,x2,x3,x4…,xn and y is the dependent variable.
y = b0 + b1x1 + b2x2 + b3x3 +....+ bnxn
